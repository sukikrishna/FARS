My best idea, and where I use it now, is attached to the arm of my executive style office chair, near where it meets the chair back.  I don't knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.  It is really a nifty place to stow the headphones--within easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well-constructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.

       "21  Can't get any simpler that this.  And it works just about anywhere you can find a flat lip or side panel.  Ideally the lip should be at least 1 3/8&#34; for best stability, but I got it to hold decently well on the short lip of my desk top, which is just 3/4&#34;.<br /><br />Because the front hanger piece can be adjusted to hang parallel or perpendicular, (or any angle in between), to the clamping surface, I was able to get the firmest grip on the side of a bookcase.  My best idea, and where I use it now, is attached to the arm of my executive style office chair, near where it meets the chair back.  I don't knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.  It is really a nifty place to stow the headphones--within easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either.<br /><br />It is well-constructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.  Hardware looks to be top quality, too.<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Brainwavz.   \n",

I have tried other chargers and they just would not bring the alkaline batteries up high enough to last, this one does.  It also meters when it is done and if you put a battery that is already charged, it show fully charged.  Real happy with this purchase as I had quite a few alkaline batteries ready to go to recycle and now I using almost all of them for the past month. I have been only buying rechargeable batteries for the last year and Yes, they cost a lot more but now I do not have too.  If a battery is damaged or old the charger will say &amp;#34;Bad&amp;#34;.

The versatility is fantastic, by setting up the base with my desktop as Aux, I can stream music from a website.  I can play music from iTunes or iTunes jukebox and control it with my iPod or play music direct from my iPod.  The sound quality is good and certainly meets my needs.  The best thing though is Altec Lansing is currently selling it at half price with free shipping!   \n",

I am impressed with this product. I have tried other chargers and they just would not bring the alkaline batteries up high enough to last, this one does.  It also meters when it is done and if you put a battery that is already charged, it show fully charged.  Real happy with this purchase as I had quite a few alkaline batteries ready to go to recycle and now I using almost all of them for the past month. I have been only buying rechargeable batteries for the last year and Yes, they cost a lot more but now I do not have too.  If a battery is damaged or old the charger will say &#34;Bad&#34;. Thanks for the great product with the USB charging station too.   \n",

The versatility is fantastic, by setting up the base with my desktop as Aux, I can stream music from a website.

I have tried other chargers and they just would not bring the alkaline batteries up high enough to last, this one does.  It also meters when it is done and if you put a battery that is already charged, it show fully charged.  Real happy with this purchase as I had quite a few alkaline batteries ready to go to recycle and now I using almost all of them for the past month. I have been only buying rechargeable batteries for the last year and Yes, they cost a lot more but now I do not have too.  If a battery is damaged or old the charger will say &amp;#34;Bad&amp;#34;.

I am impressed with this product. I have tried other chargers and they just would not bring the alkaline batteries up high enough to last, this one does.  It also meters when it is done and if you put a battery that is already charged, it show fully charged.  Real happy with this purchase as I had quite a few alkaline batteries ready to go to recycle and now I using almost all of them for the past month. I have been only buying rechargeable batteries for the last year and Yes, they cost a lot more but now I do not have too.  If a battery is damaged or old the charger will say &#34;Bad&#34;. Thanks for the great product with the USB charging station too.   \n",
