And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either.

       "165832   First of all, these cans don't look cool like Beats. You will see no NBA players wearing them. The band sticks out awkwardly from the top of your head. And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).<br /><br />Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.<br /><br />This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.<br /><br />If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!<br /><br />Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.<br /><br />I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!<br /><br />Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features.

And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either.

I ordered these to hold a couple of Vizio Soundbar surround sound speakers in our TV/game room. Based on reviews of other stands, these are one of the few that will work with the Vizio speakers...and they do mostly, with a little tweaking to the mounting bracket to accommodate the RCA connector as mentioned in other reviews.  That said, the overall quality of the speaker stands is mediocre at best. The bases are heavy but made out of &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34; metal and appeared to be painted with a spray can. The logos are splotchy and also poorly painted on. The metal is soft...one of the support columns easily cross-threaded. There are pads on the feet to protect non-carpted floors but one pad was missing and another stuck to the bubble wrap making it useless. Luckily the room they're in is carpeted.  The support columns are adequate. They come in two pieces and adjust like a mic stand, but they are no where near mic stand quality.  The rest of the pieces were all there but are typical low-end Chinese manufacturing standard in that everything just barely fits. Chinese manufacturing can be exquisite of course...it all depends on the seller's specs, and in this case Pyle's were not very demanding.  The good news is that the inside of the columns and the holes in the mounts are large enough to accommodate the straight end of the RCA connectors when they're threaded through...something others had problems with on other stands.  So for holding a pair of really light, basic surround sound speakers where quality isn't top of mind they'll do. If you want to impress friends with your audio system in your living room or HT, these are not your best option.</td>\n",

A quick review of a YouTube video and I was a TV repairman.  Installation was really quite easy, took maybe 20 minutes.</td>\n",

       "165832  First of all, these cans don't look cool like Beats. You will see no NBA players wearing them. The band sticks out awkwardly from the top of your head. And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).<br /><br />Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.<br /><br />This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.<br /><br />If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!<br /><br />Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.<br /><br />I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!<br /><br />Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either.

I knew the Pyle name from working with A/V equipment over a few decades and expected better.  I ordered these to hold a couple of Vizio Soundbar surround sound speakers in our TV/game room. Based on reviews of other stands, these are one of the few that will work with the Vizio speakers...and they do mostly, with a little tweaking to the mounting bracket to accommodate the RCA connector as mentioned in other reviews.  That said, the overall quality of the speaker stands is mediocre at best. The bases are heavy but made out of &#34;lumpy&#34; metal and appeared to be painted with a spray can. The logos are splotchy and also poorly painted on. The metal is soft...one of the support columns easily cross-threaded. There are pads on the feet to protect non-carpted floors but one pad was missing and another stuck to the bubble wrap making it useless. Luckily the room they're in is carpeted.  The support columns are adequate. They come in two pieces and adjust like a mic stand, but they are no where near mic stand quality.  The rest of the pieces were all there but are typical low-end Chinese manufacturing standard in that everything just barely fits. Chinese manufacturing can be exquisite of course...it all depends on the seller's specs, and in this case Pyle's were not very demanding.  The good news is that the inside of the columns and the holes in the mounts are large enough to accommodate the straight end of the RCA connectors when they're threaded through...something others had problems with on other stands.  So for holding a pair of really light, basic surround sound speakers where quality isn't top of mind they'll do. If you want to impress friends with your audio system in your living room or HT, these are not your best option.   \n",

Less than $200 to prevent spending $2,500 or more on a new TV is money well spent.  Definitely use the Arctic Silver paste to marry this chip to the heat sink.  When you see the condition of the heat transfer material Samsung used you'll see the Achilles heel of these TVs.  A quick review of a YouTube video and I was a TV repairman.  Installation was really quite easy, took maybe 20 minutes.   \n",

       "      <td>First of all, these cans don't look cool like Beats. You will see no NBA players wearing them. The band sticks out awkwardly from the top of your head. And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for.

       "      <td>If you're looking for quality, keep looking. I knew the Pyle name from working with A/V equipment over a few decades and expected better.  I ordered these to hold a couple of Vizio Soundbar surround sound speakers in our TV/game room. Based on reviews of other stands, these are one of the few that will work with the Vizio speakers...and they do mostly, with a little tweaking to the mounting bracket to accommodate the RCA connector as mentioned in other reviews.  That said, the overall quality of the speaker stands is mediocre at best. The bases are heavy but made out of &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34; metal and appeared to be painted with a spray can. The logos are splotchy and also poorly painted on. The metal is soft...one of the support columns easily cross-threaded. There are pads on the feet to protect non-carpted floors but one pad was missing and another stuck to the bubble wrap making it useless. Luckily the room they're in is carpeted.  The support columns are adequate. They come in two pieces and adjust like a mic stand, but they are no where near mic stand quality.  The rest of the pieces were all there but are typical low-end Chinese manufacturing standard in that everything just barely fits. Chinese manufacturing can be exquisite of course...it all depends on the seller's specs, and in this case Pyle's were not very demanding.  The good news is that the inside of the columns and the holes in the mounts are large enough to accommodate the straight end of the RCA connectors when they're threaded through...something others had problems with on other stands.  So for holding a pair of really light, basic surround sound speakers where quality isn't top of mind they'll do. If you want to impress friends with your audio system in your living room or HT, these are not your best option.</td>\n",

       "165832  First of all, these cans don't look cool like Beats. You will see no NBA players wearing them. The band sticks out awkwardly from the top of your head. And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).<br /><br />Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.<br /><br />This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.<br /><br />If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!<br /><br />Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.<br /><br />I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!<br /><br />Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either.

I knew the Pyle name from working with A/V equipment over a few decades and expected better.  I ordered these to hold a couple of Vizio Soundbar surround sound speakers in our TV/game room. Based on reviews of other stands, these are one of the few that will work with the Vizio speakers...and they do mostly, with a little tweaking to the mounting bracket to accommodate the RCA connector as mentioned in other reviews.  That said, the overall quality of the speaker stands is mediocre at best. The bases are heavy but made out of &#34;lumpy&#34; metal and appeared to be painted with a spray can. The logos are splotchy and also poorly painted on. The metal is soft...one of the support columns easily cross-threaded. There are pads on the feet to protect non-carpted floors but one pad was missing and another stuck to the bubble wrap making it useless. Luckily the room they're in is carpeted.  The support columns are adequate. They come in two pieces and adjust like a mic stand, but they are no where near mic stand quality.  The rest of the pieces were all there but are typical low-end Chinese manufacturing standard in that everything just barely fits. Chinese manufacturing can be exquisite of course...it all depends on the seller's specs, and in this case Pyle's were not very demanding.  The good news is that the inside of the columns and the holes in the mounts are large enough to accommodate the straight end of the RCA connectors when they're threaded through...something others had problems with on other stands.  So for holding a pair of really light, basic surround sound speakers where quality isn't top of mind they'll do. If you want to impress friends with your audio system in your living room or HT, these are not your best option.   \n",

Less than $200 to prevent spending $2,500 or more on a new TV is money well spent.  Definitely use the Arctic Silver paste to marry this chip to the heat sink.  When you see the condition of the heat transfer material Samsung used you'll see the Achilles heel of these TVs.  A quick review of a YouTube video and I was a TV repairman.  Installation was really quite easy, took maybe 20 minutes.   \n",

And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either.

       "review_body               First of all, these cans don't look cool like Beats. You will see no NBA players wearing them. The band sticks out awkwardly from the top of your head. And the sound is not at the level of serious audiophile quality like higher end Shures. But with that said, what you get out of the box and in your ears is a very capable, idiot proof and efficiently pairing bluetooth headset with almost freakish range, no connection breaks, and an excellent battery life (I'm still on my first charge but haven't been disciplined about keeping track of how many hours I've logged, I will update with the results of that test later).<br /><br />Sound quality is perfectly acceptable, I was able to pick out a full range from lows to highs. If you're used to higher end over the ear cans or Shure type high end in-ear buds and expect the same, you will be disappointed. But why would you? These cans are designed to futz around in your house or office with. Use wired phones if you demand ultimate fidelity.<br /><br />This kind of goes to a broader point: the first steps in figuring out what kind of phones you want is: (1) budget and (2) use scenario. I have a great little pair of $29 in-ear bluetooth buds that I wear when I go to the gym or on walks. I wouldn't wear them at home. Sound quality is not great. But convenience factor is! I have a pair of nearly $300 (yes, I know, please don't tell my wife) shure earbuds that I wear on planes and sometimes at home. They are second to none for sound isolation and sound quality, but guess what, if you exercise in them you hear every thump and if you walk around in them, you'll probably get run down by a car whose horn you didn't hear. Meanwhile, if you are operating in a relatively sound free environment, you might want something like the Sennheiser 4xx series, which offers awesome sound and reasonable comfort. If you want to look really cool, buy the Beats.<br /><br />If you're buying these, you're looking for freedom, ok sound quality, and good functionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either. If you want something that you can walk around in your house or office while your phone is charging and still hear uninterrupted music or podcasts 40 feet away: these are your phones. So, think about what you must have, what you would like to have, and what's not that important and try to find a product with those features. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised!<br /><br />Speaking of function, these phones are one of the few I've run across that actually have useable remote control features. The fast forward, pause/play, volume, and rewind are all located on one headphone, and they are spaced out far enough and placed intuitively enough that you can get used to using the functions immediately. This is a big win for Panasonic since most phones are a usability fail on this front.<br /><br />I also like how the phones fold flat and scrunch up for easy traveling.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a pretty good product, but to be frank, I haven't price comparison shopped to see if there's a viable, cheaper alternative. Sennheiser, who has been doing Bluetooth for a long time and I trust, does not seem to have a product in this price range. Even their cheapest is 1.5x more. That might change. There's a Sony with mixed reviews. This is an area that changes very quickly, so do your research and keep in mind the function is that you are buying for. Good luck!<br /><br />Recommended.tionality. If you're an audiophile, don't buy them. If you want something to sweat in, don't buy these either.
