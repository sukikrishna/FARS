The only reason I got it initially at Target was because it was $40.00 off which made it $29.95.  It started off ok although the sound was nothing to jump up and down about!  But one weird thing was whenever I played a song there was a slight delay or blip before each song started.  Annoying but something I could live with.  I found out soon enough that the charge on this thing doesn't last long.  Plus when you plug the micro USB in to charge it's so hard to pull out you feel like you're going to break it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways a bit after a month this thing crapped out on me.  Totally stopped working.  Even though it said it had a full charge.  No sound.  I was really annoyed and immediately took it back to Target where they gave me a store credit which I used to get a JBL Flip 2.  Although $50 more...it was on sale for $79.95 the sound is sooooooo much better!  Spend a little more to get a better quality product!  Why not?  Don't be cheap.  I have read some of the reviews on this thing and should have before i bought it but I hope the next version they release will fix all the problems!  No wonder they had it for $40 off!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I've ever rated a product so low but I wanted the buyer to beware!  Crap....</td>\n",

It's rubbish. It will play when it feels like it but does not have a set time frame when it switches off. I have tried everything to cure this but I believe it's just bad software and it will never be put right. I just use mine as a radio player. The sound from it is very good but at over £300 it's an expensive radio. I cannot reccomend this product as it does not work well. This is my first and last Bose product. Come to the radio and that cuts out occasionally but fortunately not as often as the airplay   \n",

At first they had a lot of static until I found out that I had to turn my surround sound system to stereo because the audio cables that were plugged in don't support surround and they were trying to send signals to speakers that weren't there.  They were then very clear.  Every so often you'll come into a little bit of static when listening to CDs while you are moving around but DVDs play crystal clear and the Dolby surround is really neat.  I believe that the optical cable that is included really helps with the clarity (and you can only get Dolby with an optical cable or a digital coaxial cable which is not included). All in all I would recommend these to someone who is looking for some wireless headphones.   \n",

       "511671   I have the black one...but I guess it would be OK to post my experience here.  DON'T BUY THIS!  The only reason I got it initially at Target was because it was $40.00 off which made it $29.95.  It started off ok although the sound was nothing to jump up and down about!  But one weird thing was whenever I played a song there was a slight delay or blip before each song started.  Annoying but something I could live with.  I found out soon enough that the charge on this thing doesn't last long.  Plus when you plug the micro USB in to charge it's so hard to pull out you feel like you're going to break it off!<br /><br />Anyways a bit after a month this thing crapped out on me.  Totally stopped working.  Even though it said it had a full charge.  No sound.  I was really annoyed and immediately took it back to Target where they gave me a store credit which I used to get a JBL Flip 2.  Although $50 more...it was on sale for $79.95 the sound is sooooooo much better!  Spend a little more to get a better quality product!  Why not?  Don't be cheap.  I have read some of the reviews on this thing and should have before i bought it but I hope the next version they release will fix all the problems!  No wonder they had it for $40 off!!<br /><br />First time I've ever rated a product so low but I wanted the buyer to beware!  Crap....   \n",

I just use mine as a radio player. The sound from it is very good but at over £300 it's an expensive radio. I cannot reccomend this product as it does not work well.

       "191731   If you are wanting to use the Bose sound touch over AirPlay on Apple products don't. It's rubbish. It will play when it feels like it but does not have a set time frame when it switches off. I have tried everything to cure this but I believe it's just bad software and it will never be put right. I just use mine as a radio player. The sound from it is very good but at over £300 it's an expensive radio. I cannot reccomend this product as it does not work well. This is my first and last Bose product. Come to the radio and that cuts out occasionally but fortunately not as often as the airplay   \n",
