I wore them on a 2 hour hike, they did not fall out once, and I never had to adjust them for comfort.<br />- Cord Length seems to be longer than most which, for me, is a plus<br />- Sound Isolation - This is caused by the fit of the earbuds in your ears.  For me, I heard virtually no outside noise<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Horrible sound quality.  I am NOT an ausiophile...I usually use cheapy earbuds or earphones.  But these were awful.  Absolutely no bass response, and the highs were absent as well.  Everything sounded timmy and the low end was muted.  They are going back for this reason<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!!   \n",

       "301172   Underwater Audio has been the greatest IPOD I have ever had. I have to do boring physical therapy exercises in the pool along with swimming laps. My IPOD work perfectly until recently. When I called the customer service center for help troubleshooting the IPOD I was stunned that they would send me a brand new one at no cost to me except shipping. I have ordered many things from many different companies and have never had such exceptional customer service. Lynzi was exceptional. While we were talking, we got disconnected and before I could call back she called me. The original IPOD I had was an engraved gift from my husband. The one they are replacing it with will also be engraved. Up until now I have told everyone how great my IPOD has been. I can't wait to tell people how wonderful their customer service has been to me....Thank You for making swimming and exercise at the pool a lot of fun. This company is diffidently 5 stars.   \n",
