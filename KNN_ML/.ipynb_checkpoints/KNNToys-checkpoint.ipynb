It really flies and will survive hard crashes but it is not an airplane for beginners. The radio allows controlling the RPM of the engines in only 3 steps: off, low and high. Left-right direction is controlled only like full left - straight - full right. With the direction this is not such a problem but doing the same with the speed so that the plane is not going up or down but straight can be a challenge. If you can fly RC aircraft and are looking for something cheap which flyes on little space and does not need any maintenance, this can be interesting.  I am not expert but I can fly an RC airplane with proportional control reasonably well. I had hard time to keep this in the air at first. It can be learned but if you have never flown anything, this one will be too fast and requires the pilot to do too many things just to keep flying straight. If you are serious about RC planes get something with proportional radio - which will probably start at about $100. If you want toy for kids, this is doubtfull because it isn't much fun to crash all the time and eventually something will break - though the construction is tough and survived already several hard crashes. In this category of 2-engine toy-planes this is good choice. The price is nice. There are airplanes with the same parameters for $40 and even more.</td>\n",

       "2796050  So, DQ4 Hero is a very nice looking figure. It is a decent size, and the accessories are cool, and accurate. As a big fan of Dragon Quest, and especially DQ4-6 on the Nintendo DS, I very much like what I got, but...<br /><br />He doesn't stand so great. Many of his joints are iffy, and posing can be tricky. His shoulder pieces are literally held on by hope, and the slightest bump can knock them loose. They don't snap back on so much as hold on by a hair, and beg the air not to pop them off, again. The sword also fits loose in the hand.<br /><br />The rest is nice. The Zenithian Sword and Shield are good looking, and the armor seems right. Overall, i very much like him. It's a piece I've been looking for since I saw some years ago, and the sets on racks. very cool.   \n",
