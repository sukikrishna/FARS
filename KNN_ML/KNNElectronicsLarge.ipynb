However, after a few hours of setup, most things worked fine.    My biggest gripe though is that about a year after buying this remote, many of the buttons don't work. In fact, pretty much all of the buttons we use on a regular basis are completely useless. This despite the fact that we have taken extremely good care of it and it still looks like new.     Also, a number of our electronics aren't supported by the remote such as our Sony Google Bluray. I'm sure it would function with a lot of work on my end but since the buttons don't work it would be a waste of effort.    I am very unsatisfied with this purchase.</td>\n",

As far as universal fit IEMs go, it's comparable with the FitEar ToGo 334 and the Sennheiser IE800s (I own both) but slightly more revealing.  Imaging and soundstage are fantastic.  Works well without benefit of headphone amp (compelling sound straight from iPod/iPhone)<br /><br />In a different league than Westone 4, Schure 535 and Sennheiser IE80s but not by 2x (i.e., law of diminishing returns: price vs performance.)<br /><br />The downside?  Price, cabling (seems delicate/not user-replaceable) and therefore IEMs that you might not want to use in a mobile context for fear of breakage.   \n",

The computer interface requires navigation through multiple screens and many of my products required quite a bit of playing around before they worked like I wanted. However, after a few hours of setup, most things worked fine.    My biggest gripe though is that about a year after buying this remote, many of the buttons don't work. In fact, pretty much all of the buttons we use on a regular basis are completely useless. This despite the fact that we have taken extremely good care of it and it still looks like new.     Also, a number of our electronics aren't supported by the remote such as our Sony Google Bluray. I'm sure it would function with a lot of work on my end but since the buttons don't work it would be a waste of effort.    I am very unsatisfied with this purchase.   \n",
       "2781187  Sony used to have a great reputation for high quality products.  But these are junk.<br /><br />The headphones broke in about 3 weeks.<br />The battery compartment door is flimsy and the battery falls out especially if you drop it from a small height.<br />The ability to separate FM stations is pathetic; various other stations -not even close on the dial- constantly break in.<br />The ability to receive FM stations is pathetic.  I can walk behind my house and suddenly get static. I go a few miles down the road and have zero reception of any station. Indoors, such as using a bathroom on my walking route, and I get static.<br />The weather radio reception is close to nonexistent.<br /><br />Battery life, using a rechargeable AAA, is good enough for my purpose, maybe 8 hours or so, but hardly outstanding.<br /><br />I haven't found a replacement for these yet, based on reviews from this site everything seems to be junk.  But, I wouldn't buy this version for sure.   \n",

SET UP IS EASY AND QUICK. ONLY THING YOU MAY NEED AN AMP OR A RECEIVER WITH ADEQUATE INPUTS..  RECEPTION IS EXCELLENT SINCE, I LIVE OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC.  THE SOUND IS OBVIOUSLY DIGITAL AND IT IS ALMOST CLOSE TO THE FULL AUDIO SPECTRUM.  A GOOD BUY FROM SANGEAN WHO IS POPULAR FOR SHORT WAVE RADIOS.  IF ONE WISHES TO FIND THE STATIONS EITHER HE OR SHE COULD SCAN THE HD SECTION OF THE TUNER OR TRY A SEARCH ENGINE.  WHY THEY NAMED IT HD RADIO? WHO KNOWS? HI-BRID COULD BE AN IDEAL NAME.   \n",

Works well without benefit of headphone amp (compelling sound straight from iPod/iPhone)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a different league than Westone 4, Schure 535 and Sennheiser IE80s but not by 2x (i.e., law of diminishing returns: price vs performance.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside?  Price, cabling (seems delicate/not user-replaceable) and therefore IEMs that you might not want to use in a mobile context for fear of breakage.</td>\n",

       "\"The AKG K3003I is a pretty amazing piece of audio gear. As far as universal fit IEMs go, it's comparable with the FitEar ToGo 334 and the Sennheiser IE800s (I own both) but slightly more revealing.  Imaging and soundstage are fantastic.  Works well without benefit of headphone amp (compelling sound straight from iPod/iPhone)<br /><br />In a different league than Westone 4, Schure 535 and Sennheiser IE80s but not by 2x (i.e., law of diminishing returns: price vs performance.)<br /><br />The downside?  Price, cabling (seems delicate/not user-replaceable) and therefore IEMs that you might not want to use in a mobile context for fear of breakage.\""
