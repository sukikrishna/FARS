Hate it but its true.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same  Pyrithione zinc (1%)  as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time it was different. This shampoo works on all fronts.  I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone.  Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product that I will be buying regularly.</td>\n",

The are huge, every brush has different density and fiber. I own quite a few high(est) end Chikuhodo, Koyudo, ect, but I have not even reached for the beloved Fu-Pa since these beauties came home. Simple: synthetic bristles are designed to work with cream product.<br /> The HUGE flat kabuki F17 blends RMS's UnCover Up & W3LL People's Narcissist in just a few sweeps, keeping product waste to a bare minimum & leaves flawless streak free finish, even beats the Rae Morris Radiance. The slanted kabuki is amazing at diffusing Ilia or Vapour Multi-Use Stick blush/stains. The more dense F13 works wonders on contouring the cheekbones, temple & hairline areas, as it can be shaped into a thinner flat end bcz of the densely packed bristles. F14 good for packing some mineral powder on if needed for extra SUV protection or just quick sweep of finishing powder with the big fluffy soft F15 (natural hair) & not a worry in the world about ruining any of them when you toss them in the make up bag: $20!<br /> I don't use much product, so I wash them once a week. Not a single hair loss, shape & feel has retained just as new as well. Fantastic Make!   \n",

       "2950239  So I have horrible winter dandruff, every year since I was a kid.  Full on flake fest.  Hate it but its true.<br />Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.<br />Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same  Pyrithione zinc (1%)  as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.<br /><br />The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.<br /><br />This time it was different. This shampoo works on all fronts.  I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone.  Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...<br /><br />A great product that I will be buying regularly.   \n",

       "      <td>So I have horrible winter dandruff, every year since I was a kid.  Full on flake fest.  Hate it but its true.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same  Pyrithione zinc (1%)  as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time it was different. This shampoo works on all fronts.  I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone.  Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product that I will be buying regularly.</td>\n",

The are huge, every brush has different density and fiber. I own quite a few high(est) end Chikuhodo, Koyudo, ect, but I have not even reached for the beloved Fu-Pa since these beauties came home. Simple: synthetic bristles are designed to work with cream product.<br /> The HUGE flat kabuki F17 blends RMS's UnCover Up & W3LL People's Narcissist in just a few sweeps, keeping product waste to a bare minimum & leaves flawless streak free finish, even beats the Rae Morris Radiance. The slanted kabuki is amazing at diffusing Ilia or Vapour Multi-Use Stick blush/stains. The more dense F13 works wonders on contouring the cheekbones, temple & hairline areas, as it can be shaped into a thinner flat end bcz of the densely packed bristles. F14 good for packing some mineral powder on if needed for extra SUV protection or just quick sweep of finishing powder with the big fluffy soft F15 (natural hair) & not a worry in the world about ruining any of them when you toss them in the make up bag: $20!<br /> I don't use much product, so I wash them once a week. Not a single hair loss, shape & feel has retained just as new as well. Fantastic Make!   \n",

       "2950239  So I have horrible winter dandruff, every year since I was a kid.  Full on flake fest.  Hate it but its true.<br />Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.<br />Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same  Pyrithione zinc (1%)  as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.<br /><br />The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.<br /><br />This time it was different. This shampoo works on all fronts.  I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone.  Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...<br /><br />A great product that I will be buying regularly.   \n",
