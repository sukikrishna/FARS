One for each of my parents' two homes. I initially showed her how to use it, and off she went! She was having fun with Pandora all day.<br /><br />My mom likes to listen to music when she cleans and tidys the house up. She likes that she can hear it in another room and the sound is still clear.<br /><br />She loves it! What a great value! She's thrilled with the product and I'm happy she's happy. It was money well spent.   \n",
       "2565477  [[ASIN:B004YI3LGY Logitech Ultimate Ears 350vi Noise-Isolating Headset (Silver)]]   Being hard of hearing, I thought the sound was great. Unfortunately I do not have a smart phone and the buds wont fit my Kyocera Vera phone. They do fit my Panasonic portable CD player except the remote does not work but the remote that came with the player works. I wish the new buds did. Also one suggestionn, the remote for the new buds could be a about 4\\\\\" further away from the earphones so that you coudl see what you are adjusting. I still will use the new buds since I like the sound.    Mel G   \n",
